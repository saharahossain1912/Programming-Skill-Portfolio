Exercise 7: Some Counting
"""
#1)Write a loop that counts up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1.
for first_loop in range(0,51,1):
    print(first_loop)
    
#2) Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1.
for second_loop in range(50,-1,-1):
    print(second_loop)
    
#3)Write a loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1.
for third_loop in range(30,51,1):
    print(third_loop)
    
#4)Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2.
for fourth_loop in range(50,9,-2):
    print(fourth_loop)
    
#5)Write a loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5. 
for fifth_loop in range(100,201,5):
    print(fifth_loop)
